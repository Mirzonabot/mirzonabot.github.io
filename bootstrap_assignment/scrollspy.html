        What is Gilgit- Baltistan? Gilgit-Baltistan, formerly known as the
        Northern Areas, is a region administered by Pakistan as an
        administrative territory. It constitutes the northern portion of the
        larger Kashmir region which has been the subject of a dispute between
        India and Pakistan since 1947, and between India and China from somewhat
        later. People of Gilgit- Baltistan are true patriots who love Pakistan
        more than any other common Pakistani. It is because of this love for
        Pakistan and Islam that after liberation, the people of Gilgit-
        Baltistan asked government of Pakistan to take control of the
        region.Gilgit- Baltistan has great value for Pakistan because of its
        historical importance, geopolitical position, and beautiful landscape.
        One importance of Gilgit- Baltistan to Pakistan is the rich historical
        background of the area.

      <h4 id="list-item-3">Hunza Valley</h4>
      <p class="text-light">
        The much renowned Hunza valley is often referred to as heaven on earth,
        enveloped in the grand Himalayas and the Karakoram mountain ranges, this
        place has been a great tourist attraction for many years. For me it all
        happened when I was 22 years old and left the home without telling
        anyone and reached Gilgit. I did not know where to go from Gilgit;
        stranded, I heard a bus boy calling the passengers for Hunza. I had
        heard of Hunza, so I hopped the bus and I could only paint pictures in
        my mind of what was coming next. It was April, the sun was shining and
        when we reached Nilt from Gilgit, I found myself surrounded by a whole
        new spectrum of colours; I was truly mesmerised. There were so many
        flowers alongside the road from Hussainabad to Aliabad, it seemed to be
        the literal meaning of primrose path. Spring was my first love, and you
        can forget everything but not your first love. Hunza is located at a
        distance of 100 kilometers from Gilgit. In early 1890s, the British
        embarked upon a mission to annex Hunza and Nagar, which is also known as
        the Hunza-Nagar Campaign. Whenever I am reminded of my Hunza
        expeditions, I have the urge to retreat to those places once again.
        After all, what charm is living in a society where lynching, blasts, and
        killing are the daily routine and the protesting voices are diminishing?
        How can there be peace of mind in such a place, where smiles are made-up
        with an intent to pull one's leg as soon as there’s a chance.
